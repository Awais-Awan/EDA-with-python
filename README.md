# Exploratory Data Analysis with Python 🎢

Welcome to the EDA with Python repository! This project explores a dataset of roller coasters, providing insights and visualizations using various Python libraries.

## Project Overview 📊
This project is focused on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a roller coaster dataset. The analysis is conducted using popular Python libraries, enabling a deep dive into the data to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships.

## Dataset 🎢
The dataset used in this project is `coaster_db.csv`, which contains various attributes related to roller coasters. The dataset includes information such as coaster names, heights, speeds, locations, and much more.

## Key Steps in the Analysis 🛠️
1. **Data Loading and Inspection**: The data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, and its structure is explored (shape, columns, etc.).
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and preparing the data for analysis.
3. **Data Visualization**: Creating insightful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to better understand the data.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to explore relationships between variables using SciPy.

## Libraries and Tools Used 🛠️
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced statistical visualizations.
- **SciPy**: For statistical analysis.
